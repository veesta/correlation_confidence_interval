#prediction intervals 
#what range of study correlation values might you expect due to sampling error alone 

library(predictionInterval)

#previous study got r=.41 based on n = 70 
#want to conduct a replication using a sample of n = 214

#confidence interval = .19 to .59 -> means population correlation responsible for .41 could be as low as .19 or high .59

psych::r.con(r=.41, n=70)

#prediction interval - what replication correlation range can you get just from sampling error though 

pi.r(r=0.41,n=70,rep.n=214)

#Original study: r = 0.41, N = 70, 95% CI[0.19, 0.59]
#Replication study: N = 214
#Prediction interval: 95% PI[0.17,0.62].

##interpretation 
# If the replication correlation differs from the original correlation only due to sampling error, 
#there is a 95% chance the replication result will fall in this interval. 
#If the replication correlation falls outside of this range, factors beyond sampling error are likely 
#also responsible for the difference.

#wide range because sample size is small
